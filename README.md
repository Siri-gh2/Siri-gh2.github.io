## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- Build **strong Python fundamentals**
- Develop **data handling skills** required for AI/ML
- Practice **clean coding and logical thinking**
- Learn in public through **structured daily posts**
- Create a **resume-ready learning portfolio** aligned with AI/ML roles

This is a **learning journal**, not a tutorial library.

## 📚 What I’m Learning Here

### 🐍 Python Core (Foundation for AI/ML)
- Variables, data types, operators
- Conditional statements
- Loops and control flow
- Functions and modular code
- Input/output handling
- Error awareness and debugging

---

### 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)
- Classes and objects
- `__init__` and `self`
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Hands-on OOPS implementations (bank system, login system, vehicle models)

OOPS concepts are practiced to understand **scalable and reusable code**, which is essential in real-world AI/ML systems.

---

### 📊 NumPy (Numerical Computing)
- Array creation and reshaping
- Multi-dimensional slicing
- Vectorized operations
- Boolean indexing
- Mathematical operations
- Random number generation
- Simulation-based practice

NumPy forms the **computational backbone** of most AI/ML libraries.

---

### 🐼 Pandas (Data Handling & Analysis)
- Series and DataFrames
- Panel data concepts
- Structured data manipulation
- Real-world dataset handling
- Preparing data for analysis and ML workflows

Pandas is used to **clean, transform, and analyze data** before applying ML models.

---

### 🧠 Practice, Logic & Assessments
- Daily hands-on coding practice
- Logical problem solving
- Self-assessment quizzes
- Mini practice tasks aligned with real use cases
