## Environment Setup: Installing Anaconda

To begin working with Python, I installed Anaconda on my system. Anaconda is a distribution that simplifies Python development, particularly for data science and machine learning.

### Why Anaconda?

- **Includes Python and commonly used libraries** – avoids manual installation of core packages.
- **Provides Jupyter Notebook for interactive coding** – useful for experiments and quick tests.
- **Simplifies environment and package management** – helps avoid version and dependency conflicts.
- **Suitable for both beginners and advanced users** – widely used in data and scientific workflows.

With Anaconda installed, the system is ready for writing and executing Python programs.

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in software development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, and scientific computing.

### Key Features

- **High-level language:** abstracts low-level details, allowing developers to focus on logic rather than system operations.
- **Readable and human-friendly syntax:** the syntax is close to English, which makes Python easier to learn and understand.
- **Object-oriented programming support:** enables the use of classes, objects, and other OOP concepts.
- **Interpreted language:** executes code line by line, making debugging and testing easier.
- **Case sensitivity:** identifiers such as `Apple` and `apple` are treated as different.
- **Extensive library support:** libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy provide ready-made functionality.
- **Concise code:** many tasks can be implemented in fewer lines compared to other languages.

## Summary

Day 1 covered installing Anaconda and understanding the basics of Python.  
The next step is to begin writing simple Python programs involving variables, data types, input/output, and basic operations.
