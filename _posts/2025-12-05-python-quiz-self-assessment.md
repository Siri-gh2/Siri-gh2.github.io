## 📋 Test Your Python Knowledge — Quiz

I’ve created a quick self-assessment quiz to help you consolidate what you’ve learned so far: sets, dictionaries, loops, functions, and basic Python syntax and logic.  

👉 Take the quiz here:

## 🧠 Why This Quiz

As you progress through the tutorials and code snippets on this blog, it’s easy to write code — but understanding and internalizing concepts sometimes requires active recall. This quiz will help you:

- Check if you really understand sets vs dictionaries  
- Practice thinking about functions, loops, and data-structure logic  
- Test your knowledge independently, without immediately jumping into code  
- Track your own learning — revisit the quiz after a few days to see improvement

## 📌 How to Use It Effectively

1. **Don’t open code** while attempting — treat it like a test.  
2. Write down your answers on paper or a text file, then compare with your own code (or documentation).  
3. If you get something wrong — revisit the related blog post (Sets, Dicts, Functions etc.) and retry.  
4. Try the quiz again after some time — you might see improvement.  

Happy learning!
