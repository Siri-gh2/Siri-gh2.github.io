# Python OOPs – Self-Assessment Quiz

To reinforce the concepts learned across **OOP Day 11, 12, and 13**, here is a structured self-assessment quiz designed to evaluate your understanding of:

- Encapsulation  
- Access modifiers (public, protected, private)  
- Getter & Setter methods  
- Inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid)  
- Method overriding  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction  
- Real-world OOP modeling

## 📌 How to Attempt the Quiz

Here is the recommended way to take this self-assessment:

1. **Do not open your notes** while answering — treat this as a knowledge check.  
2. After submitting, revisit questions you got wrong.  
3. Refer to your Day 11, Day 12, and Day 13 posts to revise missing concepts.  
4. Re-take the quiz after 2–3 days to ensure retention.

## 🎯 Why This Quiz Matters

Understanding OOP deeply is **non-negotiable** if you want to build:

- Scalable applications  
- Clean backend systems  
- Real-world software architecture  
- Interview-ready class design thinking  

This quiz ensures you’re not just reading code — you’re *thinking* like an object-oriented developer.

📌 How to Use It Effectively
Don’t open code while attempting — treat it like a test.
Write down your answers on paper or a text file, then compare with your own code (or documentation).
If you get something wrong — revisit the related blog post (Sets, Dicts, Functions etc.) and retry.
Try the quiz again after some time — you might see improvement.
Happy learning!
